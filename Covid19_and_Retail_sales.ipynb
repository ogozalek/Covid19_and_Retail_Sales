    "This project uses the ETL process on the Monthly Retail Trade Survey (MRTS) dataset to explore how the COVID-19 lockdowns affected certain categories of retail and food services sales in the year 2020. After extracting, transforming, and loading the data into a MySQL database, queries are written to explore the data using trends, percentage change, and rolling time windows. The matplotlib library is used to create plots for visualization of the data. Conclusions reached based on data analysis is that sales in selected categories decreased during the COVID lockdown that started in March 2020 and then eventually started increasing again. "

    "Each month the United States Census Bureau produces monthly estimates of monthly sales and end-of-month inventories from data collected in the Monthly Retail Trade Survey (MRTS), based on reports from firms selected for the survey sample. This project will use the ETL process on the MRTS dataset to explore how the COVID-19 lockdowns affected certain categories of retail and food services sales in the year 2020. \n",

    "### 2.3 Data Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "The process used for data preparation in this project is largely determined by my choice to use the CSV library to read the data into Python. I use the CSV library rather than pandas because that appears to be the recommendation for this project. The choice seems reasonable--a Google search suggests that CSV is faster for smaller (<1K) datasets, while pandas is faster for larger datasets.  Unlike pandas, however, which includes a *read_excel* function that directly interfaces with Excel, the CSV library only provides for reading existing CSV files. For this reason, it seems to make sense to prepare the data for CSV format when the data is still in Excel. For example, while the *read_excel* function in pandas provides for reading multiple worksheets into a single CSV file, using the CSV library seems to necessitate that this step be done by writing a Visual Basic program in Excel. \n",
    "\n",
    "When preparing the data for extraction from Excel, I tried to anticipate what form I would eventually need the data to be in. At this stage, my main goal was to avoid losing any data, in case it would be needed later on. In retrospect, this goal proved to be counterproductive. For example, I started copying data from all the different yearly worksheets into a single worksheet but soon stopped when I calculated how long that would take. Similarly, knowing that I would be analyzing trends over time, I started pivoting the Excel tables to place \"Month/Year\" as a column, but then stopped when I realized that the table I had in mind would have over 65 columns. For some reason, I did not consider selecting subsets of the different kinds-of-business columns or the different years worksheets or creating a different version of the SQL mrts table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Preparations I did perform in Excel include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Remove rows of descriptive text at the top and bottom of each sheet\n",
    "* Remove the adjusted data\n",
    "* Remove column headers altogether to make eventually loading data into SQL easier (could also be accomplished by using *next( )* function in Python\n",
    "* Change dates from number to text format\n",
    "* Remove commas from numeric data\n",
    "* Change missing data to zeros (I made this decision after spending a lot of time replacing missing data by using percentage formulas based on similar data--these calculations are saved and could be used in the future)\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this process, I prepared 5 worksheets of data (years 2017 through 2021) for extraction as separate CSV files to Python and then SQL. None of the data has been lost for these five years. To extract the data as a CSV files, I selected *CSV UTF-8 (comma delimited)* file format from the Excel Save As command.

In all business categories, there was a significant dip in sales in March, when COVID hit and the lockdowns went into effect.\n",

    "What is surprising to me is how quickly the economy, as evidenced by this sales data, seemed to recover. The \"Total retail and food services sales\" data was especially encouraging. I look forward to working with an updated MRTS dataset at some point, maybe a few years from now when the effects of COVID will become more evident.\n",

    "On a coding note, this project was quite a learning experience. As I worked on the project, I felt like I had painted myself into a corner by using the CSV library instead of pandas. Now that I am reflecting on the experience, I would say that I gained invaluable experience in MySQL problem solving skills, as well as the hard-earned insight that I could have written code in the Python environment to transform my CSV-based data to pandas dataframes.\n",
