Explore effects of Covid-19 lockdowns on retail prices<br>
 This project uses the ETL process on the Monthly Retail Trade Survey (MRTS) dataset to explore how the COVID-19 lockdowns affected certain categories of retail and food services sales in the year 2020. After extracting, transforming, and loading the data into a MySQL database, queries are written to explore the data using trends, percentage change, and rolling time windows. The matplotlib library is used to create plots for visualization of the data. Conclusions reached based on data analysis is that sales in selected categories decreased during the COVID lockdown that started in March 2020 and then eventually started increasing again.
